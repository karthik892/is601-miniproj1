# Push

* The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

* Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

* For example, while write code in local master on webstorm, we use git push command to upload our code to the remote master on github.
