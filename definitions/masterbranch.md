# Master Branch (main branch)

* When you first create a repository, git will create a default branch called ``main`` 

* This was previously called ``master`` , but services like GitHub have started transitioning away from this due to its reference to slavery

* Unless otherwise specified, any future branch that you create is a "fork" of the ``main`` branch

* When cloning a repository, git will usually checkout the default branch (``main``), you can easily switch to another branch with the ``checkout`` command
