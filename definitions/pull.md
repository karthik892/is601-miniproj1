# Pull

* The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

* Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.

* For example, Git pull helps us download updated remote master to local master in our webstorm project.
