# Branch

Branching is a way to maintain multiple versions of a code base.

For example:
* When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
* This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.

## Creating a branch

To create a branch you must run the following command

```
git branch <branch-name>
```

Dont forget to ``checkout`` the branch before commiting to it
