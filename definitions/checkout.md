# Checkout

* A "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity.

* The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.

* In the Undoing Changes topic, we saw how git checkout can be used to view old commits.

* For example, git checkout is used to get pull request on local, fix bug, added features to a branch.
