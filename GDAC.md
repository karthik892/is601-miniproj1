# How the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company?

## Continuous integration

* Is a development practice in which developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.
  
* This allows developers to easily integrate functionality with the existing code. 
  
* Automated testing ensured that any commit made to the code does not result in new errors being introduced into production code.

## Docker

* Help developers to build their code and test their code in any environment to catch bugs early in the application development life cycle. 

* Dockers help streamline the process, save time on builds, and allows developers to run tests in parallel.

* Can integrate with source control management tools like GitHub and Integration tools like Jenkins.

* Developers submit the code into GitHub, test the code that automatically triggers a build using Jenkins creating an image. This image can be added to Docker registry to deal with inconsistencies between different environment types.

### This results in coherance in the development of softwares in organisations and help build software in a fast manner increasing productivity and competitiveness.
